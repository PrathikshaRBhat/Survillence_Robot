Border patrol system have recently achieved interest to address the concerns about national security and it consists of security checkpoints and border troops.
Under the conventional border patrol system, even modest-sized areas require large human resources if manual patrolling is considered alone. 
In order to monitor the border in real-time with accuracy and minimize the need for human support, multiple surveillance technologies are required.
To address the challenges still faced by the existing surveillance techniques, a border security robot is introduced which can accurately detect the border intrusion with minimum human involvements.
Border security robot utilizes the IR sensors for obstacle detection and Bluetooth module to operate it. Also a surveillance camera is used to continuously monitor the border.
